# Process Update - Milestone 1

This document outlines the current state of the Cyber Physical Robots simulation project.

## What's Done

Based on the project description, the following items have been implemented or updated in the Python code:

1.  **Simulation Parameters Updated:**
    *   The grid size has been set to **20x20**.
    *   The number of robots per team has been set to **10**.

2.  **Robot Observation and Intelligence:**
    *   Each robot can now "see" the 8 positions in front of it, as specified in the project description.
    *   A basic AI has been implemented. Robots use their observations to find gold and move towards it.
    *   Robots now have roles (`SEEKER`, `HELPER`, `CARRIER`) to guide their behavior.

3.  **Communication and Teamwork:**
    *   A communication system has been implemented. Robots can send messages to each other.
    *   When a robot finds gold, it communicates with the closest teammate to request help for pickup.
    *   Robots now have knowledge of their team's deposit box and will move towards it when carrying gold.

4.  **Gold Pickup and Scoring Logic:**
    *   The logic for picking up gold has been corrected to require **exactly two** robots from the same team.
    *   A critical bug was fixed that prevented the Blue team from scoring, ensuring a fair simulation.

## What's Still Needed (Remaining Discrepancies)

The following features from the project description are not yet implemented:

1.  **Complex Pickup Scenario:** The special case where 4 robots (2 from each team) attempt to pick up gold simultaneously is not handled. The current logic processes each team's pickup attempt independently.
2.  **Gold Fumble Logic:** The current "fumble" logic triggers when two paired robots are on different cells. The description specifies that it should trigger when they move in different directions. While the outcome is similar, the trigger condition is not precisely as described.

## Next Steps

The following are the recommended next steps for development:

1.  **Implement Complex Pickup Rule:** Add the logic to handle the scenario where two teams attempt to pick up gold from the same cell on the same turn.
2.  **Refine Fumble Logic:** Update the fumble mechanism to check for differences in movement direction between paired robots, rather than just their final location.
3.  **Enhance Robot AI and Coordination:** The current robot AI is a good starting point. For the next milestones, it should be improved with more sophisticated control logic that uses the robot's history, observations (sensed data), and received messages to make more effective and coordinated decisions.
