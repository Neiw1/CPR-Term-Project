# Process Update - Milestone 1

This document outlines the current state of the Cyber Physical Robots simulation project.

## What's Done

Based on the project description, the following items have been implemented or updated in the Python code:

1.  **Simulation Parameters Updated:**
    *   The grid size has been set to **20x20**.
    *   The number of robots per team has been set to **10**.

2.  **Robot Observation Logic Implemented:**
    *   Each robot can now "see" the 8 positions in front of it, as specified in the project description. The observation pattern changes based on the direction the robot is facing.

3.  **Gold Pickup Logic Corrected:**
    *   The logic for picking up gold has been corrected to require **exactly two** robots from the same team. The previous implementation incorrectly allowed two or more.

## What's Still Needed (Remaining Discrepancies)

The following features from the project description are not yet implemented:

1.  **Complex Pickup Scenario:** The special case where 4 robots (2 from each team) attempt to pick up gold simultaneously is not handled. The current logic processes each team's pickup attempt independently.
2.  **Gold Fumble Logic:** The current "fumble" logic triggers when two paired robots are on different cells. The description specifies that it should trigger when they move in different directions. While the outcome is similar, the trigger condition is not precisely as described.
3.  **Robot "Knowledge" of Deposit Box:** Robots do not explicitly store the location of their team's deposit box. The `World` object currently manages this for scoring.

## Next Steps

The following are the recommended next steps for development:

1.  **Implement Complex Pickup Rule:** Add the logic to handle the scenario where two teams attempt to pick up gold from the same cell on the same turn.
2.  **Refine Fumble Logic:** Update the fumble mechanism to check for differences in movement direction between paired robots, rather than just their final location.
3.  **Improve Robot AI:** The current robot decision-making is purely random. For the next milestones, this should be replaced with more intelligent control logic that uses the robot's history, observations (sensed data), and received messages to make coordinated decisions.
4.  **Implement Communication:** The message board system is in place but is not currently used by the robots to make decisions. The next step in AI development will be to have robots communicate and coordinate their actions (e.g., meeting up to pick up gold).
